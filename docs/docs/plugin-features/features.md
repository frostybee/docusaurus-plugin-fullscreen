## Features

The Docusaurus Code Block Fullscreen plugin enhances your documentation experience by providing fullscreen functionality for code blocks. Here's a comprehensive overview of all the features available.

## Fullscreen Mode

Transform any code block into a distraction-free fullscreen view with a single click. The fullscreen mode provides:

- **Enhanced readability**: Code blocks expand to fill the entire screen,
- **Dark overlay**: Minimizes distractions with a semi-transparent background,
- **Optimized zoom**: Automatically applies configurable zoom levels for better code visibility.

```javascript title="Example Code Block"
// Click the fullscreen button (â›¶) to see this in fullscreen mode

// This code block will have a fullscreen button
function greetUser(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
  return `Welcome to the documentation`;
}

const user = "Developer";
greetUser(user);
```

## Keyboard Navigation

The plugin provides comprehensive keyboard support for enhanced accessibility and user experience:

### Fullscreen Controls

- **Escape key**: Quickly exit fullscreen mode (configurable),
- **Browser back button**: Use your browser's back button to exit fullscreen (configurable),
- **Tab navigation**: Full keyboard navigation support within fullscreen mode.

### Code Block Cycling

Navigate between multiple code blocks on the same page using keyboard shortcuts:

- **Tab Key**: Cycle forward through all code blocks with fullscreen buttons on the current page,
- **Enter Key**: Activate the fullscreen mode for the currently focused code block,
- **Shift + Tab**: Cycle backward through code blocks (standard browser behavior).

This feature is particularly useful when you have multiple code examples and want to quickly navigate between them without using the mouse.

### Keyboard Accessibility

- **Enter Activation**: Press Enter to activate fullscreen on focused code blocks,
- **Escape Exit**: Press Escape to exit fullscreen mode.

- **Zoom Levels**: Configure fullscreen zoom levels for optimal readability,
- **Button Placement**: Control which code blocks get fullscreen buttons.

### History Integration

- **URL Management**: Manages URL state without affecting navigation,
- **State Restoration**: Correctly restores previous state when navigating.

## Usage Examples
